## üèóÔ∏è How It All Works

1. **User Sends a File**  
   - Can be a PDF, image, doc, or CSV  
   - Bot extracts the text using a combination of PDF parsing, OCR, or direct reading.

2. **Medicine Extraction**  
   - Gemini‚Äôs LLM tries to detect and list every medicine in the text (one per line!).  

3. **Frequency Prompt**  
   - The bot politely asks if you want to set 1√ó, 2√ó, or 3√ó daily consumption for each medicine.  
   - You can skip frequencies (defaults to 1 time/day) if you're in a hurry.  

4. **Duration & Address**  
   - Use `/setdays 5` to indicate how many days you need each medicine.  
   - Share your address with `/setaddress` or send a location pin.  

5. **Bill Generation**  
   - Summarizes each medicine, daily frequency, total quantity, and shows your address.  
   - Saves effort, helps the chemist fill your order quickly.  

6. **Send to Chemist**  
   - If configured, the bot forwards your digital prescription summary to a chemist chat ID.
